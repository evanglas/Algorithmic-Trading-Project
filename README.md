## Abstract
We investigate an innovative trading strategy that combines dispersion trading on the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for pairs selection in pairs trading, with regularized Markowitz portfolio optimization for optimal allocation between the two strategies in live trading. The primary objective of this research is to examine the effectiveness of this hybrid approach in generating superior risk-adjusted returns and portfolio diversification. Our empirical analysis establishes the potential of this innovative trading strategy to outperform conventional approaches in terms of risk-adjusted returns and portfolio diversification. The findings highlight the importance of employing advanced quantitative techniques in the development of robust and effective trading strategies for modern financial markets.
